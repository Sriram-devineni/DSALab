### Test Case 1

Input

```
1(2(3)(4(5)(6)))(9(7)(8))
l
r
m
```

Output

```
1 2 9 3 4 7 8 5 6
1 9 8 6
8
```

Explanation for output

```
l:prints level order traversal of tree 1 2 9 3 4 7 8 5 6.
r:prints the nodes of tree that are visible when seen through the right side of tree 1 9 8 6.
m:prints the maximum sum of BST in a binary tree 8.
```

### Test Case 2

Input

```
3
l
r
m
```

Output
```
3
3
3
```

Explanation for output
