# Automated Script evaluation similar to lab 🔥🔥🔥🔥

# Similar to lab you can only run script in the Linux environment.

## Only Prerequisite is to have Node installed on your machine(please google it install it if you don't have it).

## To run the script file just type the following command in the terminal.(for Q1 similarly for other questions same as lab)

```bash
node evaluate.js q1
```

### To avoid confusion , We implimented this script in a way that it will only run the script which is in the same directory as the script as in the lab.

### For example if you want to run script for Cycle 1 Part A then download the script file from git repo we included all test cases in that directory and run the script in the same directory as the script file.

### Running of all script files doesnt mean that your code is correct. It just means that your code is passing all the test cases which we included in the script file.

### If you have any good test cases or find any bug or typo in the script file then please keep a PR. We are happy to merge it.Please keep this pace going.

## This is the correct way learning by lifting others and lifiting ourselves up.
